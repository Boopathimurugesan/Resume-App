1)Download NSSM:

Download the NSSM tool from its official website or a trusted source. It's an executable, so there's no installation process.

2)Unzip NSSM:

Extract the contents of the downloaded NSSM.zip file to a directory of your choice.

3)Open CMD Window:

Open a Command Prompt (CMD) window with administrative privileges.

4)Navigate to NSSM Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you extracted NSSM, e.g., cd c:\nssm\bin-64\. Make sure this directory contains the nssm.exe file.
Install Solr Service:

5)Install Solr Service:

Copy the solr folder from this brach to "C:" drive

Run the following commands one by one to install Solr as a service:
nssm.exe install "Solr" "C:\Program Files\Java\jre-1.8\bin\java.exe" "-jar start.jar"
nssm.exe set "Solr" AppDirectory "C:\Solr\solrsb\server"
This will configure NSSM to create a Windows service named "Solr" using the provided Java executable and command-line arguments.

6)Check Service:

Open the Windows Services manager by typing "services.msc" in the Run dialog or search bar.
Look for the service named "Solr" in the list of services. You can check if it's running and configure it further if needed.
